README for COMP20 semester group project for group 7: Josh Berl, David McConnell, Julie Sanduski, Rex Umezuruike

• Project Title

• Problem Statement: 
Different types of crowds like different types of music. One DJ cannot typically appeal to all types of crowds. A DJ can never just guess what most people at that specific party would be interested in listening to. 

• How do you solve the problem

• List of features that will be implemented

• What data will the prototype be using and collecting

• Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary

• Electronic mockups of what will be developed using wireframes
