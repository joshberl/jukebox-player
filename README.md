README for COMP20 semester group project for group 7: Josh Berl, David McConnell, Julie Sanduski, Rex Umezuruike

Project title – 

Problem statement – Different types of crowds like different types of music. One DJ cannot typically appeal to all types of crowds. A DJ can never just guess what most people at that specific party would be interested in listening to. 

Solve the problem – This DJ App will finally create a link from our DJ to our crowd of people by allowing people to add songs to the queue to be played. 

Implementation – We will use a Spotify API for playing the songs, and MusixMatch API for displaying lyrics and an Echonest API for information about songs 

Pick 5: (1) Geolocation 
(2) Front-end framework (Boostrap)
(3) Push notifications (upvote 
(4) Client-side storage (keeps track of what was listened to)
(5) Reporting with charts and graphs 

Will be collecting songs that will be put onto a queue, upvotes and downvotes (value of these votes are relative to size of party) 

Algorithms: List (Dynamic Array), Upvoting/Downvoting Algorithm
