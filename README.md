README for COMP20 semester group project for group 7: Josh Berl, David McConnell, Julie Sanduski, Rex Umezuruike

Project title – JukeBox

Problem statement – Different types of crowds like different types of music. One DJ cannot typically appeal to all types of crowds. A DJ can never just guess what most people at that specific party would be interested in listening to. 

Solve the problem – This DJ App will finally create a link from our DJ to our crowd of people by allowing people to add songs to the queue to be played. 

Implementation – We will use a (1) Spotify API for playing the songs and a (2) a GoogleMaps API to display who has been using Jukebox around you 

Pick 5: (1) Push notifications (to play the next song)
(2) Front-end framework (Boostrap)
(3) Data or screen scraping 
(4) Server-side data persistence (MongoDB)
(5) Client-side data persistence (local storage) 


Will be collecting songs that will be put onto a queue, on page refresh the next song in the queue will be displayed 

Notes on implementation ideas:  
(1) Push notification (alert) when the next song is ready to be played
(2) Bootstrap used for buttons, forms, and as a placeholder for text
(3) Data scraping used to get code from the URL
(4) MongoDB/Server-side persistence - Saves the queue of songs
(5) Local storage saves the code on the homepage after it is generated
