#November 13 Status Report

What was accomplished:
- Set up heroku database
- Rethought individual account setup - could use cookies/local storage to track posting instead of accounts
- Layed out specific goals for the future
- Familiarized ourselves with the Spotify Web API
- Added more thorough notes/implementation ideas and goals to the README
- Got to know each other!

Challenges: 
- Individual accounts add much more complexity to the server-side development
		* Hosts need to have Spotify Premium, but accounts provide a barrier of use to listeners
		* Want to track how much people are posting, but we don't necessarily need accounts for that

Goals for next week:
- Connect Spotify API
- <B>Create an html song search and player</B>
- Figure out accounts situation
- Create a tangible schedule/outline/pseudocode for the remainder of the semester
